## 🐴 About Me

- 🐇 I'm **Xiaotian Tian** (**田晓天** in Chinese).
  - Having said that, you are welcomed to call me **Er1kKa**!
- 🖥 **I'm not professionally trained for programming! It's simply my interest.**
- 🏫 I'm pursuing a **MPhil in Economics at Oxford University** but now taking a **gap year** due to health concerns.
  - Previously, I obtained my **BSc in Economics** at UCL.
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning Statistics and Data Science
  - Planned: convex optimisation, matrix calculus
- 💬 Welcome to ask me anything!
  - or just have a casual chat~
  - pro tip: avoid Economics when choosing your major.. If you really want to major in economics, a joint programme with Stats/Maths will be more desirable.
